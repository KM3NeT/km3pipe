User Guide
==========

Welcome! KM3Pipe + associated tools are built around two different workflows:
An Event-by-event processing approach, and a 2D-table/array approach.

The preferred on-disk file format is :doc:`hdf5`, although km3pipe can read
all ROOT/Text based km3net file format like Jpp, Aanet, Evt, etc.
